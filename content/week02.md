## Intro

This week we look back at what we learned so far and get a first taste of Keras / Pytorch.

  - Turn real-world data into tensors

## Goal

The goal this week is to:

1. Start using Pytorch / Keras
2. Start learning how to deploy models

## Preparation work

Practice you Python skills, do some research for tools / ideas.
